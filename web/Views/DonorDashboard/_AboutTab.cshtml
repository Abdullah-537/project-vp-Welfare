            <h3>📖 Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                Our mission is to create a sustainable welfare ecosystem that connects generous donors with people in need.
                We believe in the power of community and aim to bridge the gap between those who can give and those who need support.
                Through transparent operations and efficient resource distribution, we strive to make every contribution count.
